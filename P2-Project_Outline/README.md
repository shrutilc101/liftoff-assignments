### Overview
Project Title : Personal Data Tracker  

Have you wondered how much of your personal data is out there with different businesses 
with varying level of security to keep that information secure? A regular person at any
given time remembers up to 13 passwords, gives out email address hundreds of times and 
has to provide date of birth, mother’s maiden name and last 4 of social so many times 
in a year. With all the data breaches taking place, did you even feel a need to learn
what data did you provide where that could be part of the exploit? 
Here is a project that aims to do just that. Now you can know what data of yours was 
compromised when that hotel chain was hacked or what data of yours was compromised when 
that web site was hacked. This app will allow you to easily record the data you provide 
to a business each time and let’s you easily search it when you hear about a hack. You 
can take action on the compromised data before that business notifies you.

### Features
o	User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. 
	Each user will have a profile page.
o	Recording Information: A very easy to use interface to record sharing of information
	with easy selection of categories and customizable information entry.
o	Search: With one or more input parameters, users will be able to find out what personal 
	information was provided to which business/entity and how that links to other information 
	that might be at risk of exploit by association.

o	Updating Information: Users will be able to update the information previously recorded.
